III.2.2 Thumbnails
	• If a research has been done, the results will show as thumbnails sorted by names.
	• If no research was done, you will show the most popular medias from your external
		sources, sorted as per the criteria of your choice (downloads, peers, seeders, etc...)
	• In addition to the name of the video, a thumbnail must be composed, if available,
		of its production year, its IMDb note and a cover image.
	• You will differentiate the videos watched from unwatched, as you prefer.
	• The list will be paginated, at the end of each page. The following one must be
		automatically charged asynchronically. That means there cannot be a link from
		each page.
	• The page will be sortable and filtered according to criteria such as name, genre,
		the IMDb grade, the gap of production year etc...
